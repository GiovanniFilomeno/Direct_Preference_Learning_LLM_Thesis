# Direct_Preference_Learning_LLM_Thesis
Master Thesis on Direct Preference Learning for LLM at Johannes Kepler University of Linz for the Artificial Intelligence (M.Sc.)

#### ToDo List - Meeting 28.11.2024
- Solid objects
- Adjust the starting point so that it does not start in the middle of an object
- Start thinking about a preference (having x_1a and x_1b, which one do we prefer?)

#### ToDo List - Meeting 06.12.2024
- More motivation (2 slides) —> why should the audience should listen me
- Comparison RL and DPO —> possible question. Why is difference? 
- How the RLHF and DPO works/happen
- Less text in case 
- how this formula works —> explain of the variables —> pi_ref and pi_theta —> what is KL divergence

#### ToDo List - Meeting 23.01.2025
- Create a distribution of positions and find a way to define, based on two positions, which one the algorithm should prefer: distribution done, preference parameters still missing for the dataset
- Writing the report

#### ToDo List - Meeting 21.02.2025
- Try a simpler maze
- Start to think about a more realistic scenario
